;THIS CODE CAN WORK AS NESTED ITE 
;BUT THE NESTED LOOP CANNOT BE ADDED TO THE IF-THEN STATEMENT 
;BECAUSE THE BRANCH STATEMENT IS ALLOWED ONLY AT THE END OF ITE.

;THE NESTED LOOP IS NOT POSSIBLE IN ARM.
;BECAUSE THE CONITIONS REQUIRED SHOULD BE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
;ALSO, THE BRANCH INSTRUCTION COULD ONLY BE USED IN THE LAST STATEMENT.

;WHEN THE ABOVE CODE IS BUILD, THEN A ERROR IS SHOWN
;Q4.s(11): error: A1603E: This instruction inside IT block has UNPREDICTABLE results
